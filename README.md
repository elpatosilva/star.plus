# star.plus
Star+ for kodi

The user experience is terrible. Is almost a not usable and incomplete thing.

I takeed a couple of nights tweaking the Disney+ fom slyguy and it kinda work.

I have no time to give it a better try, if you want to continue this work you are welcome.

Works for Series and Movies, on Featured some things works, really I give it a try for Live events (Destacados/Todo el deporte | VIVO), but is not working, contacts the streaming service but no video, lots of video messages error on log

Install:
- First of all,  Install slyguy repo, and install Disney+ addon (for dependences)
- Copy this repo to .kodi/addons, on somithing like plugin.video.star.plus
- Enable the addon on My Addons
- Go to the addon, make login and suffer this terrible addon where you can even search for nothing

IMPORTANT: Dont trust me, dont trust anybody. Check the differences (use diff) with the Disney+ code so you can see this is not a fake addon with the porpouse of to stealing users and passwords

------
NOTES:
